ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Engineer and PhD in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, currently working as a Researcher at the Laboratoire dâ€™Informatique de Grenoble (LIG) and the Laboratoire de GÃ©nie Ã‰lectrique de Grenoble (G2Elab) in France.

My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Automated Planning, with applications to smart power grids and autonomous decision-making systems.

Over the years, I have worked on topics such as:

- AI Planning & Heuristic Search
- Machine Learning & Continual Learning
- Data Mining & Knowledge Representation
- Natural Language Processing

I also enjoy teaching â€” I have over 645 hours of teaching experience at UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes, covering databases, data warehouses, text and graph mining, algorithms, and programming.

Beyond research, I am passionate about collaboration and supervision. I have co-supervised PhD and Master students on projects related to federated learning, human activity recognition, and AI planning for engineering and smart grids.

ðŸ“„ You can explore my publications and projects, or connect with me to discuss opportunities for collaboration.
