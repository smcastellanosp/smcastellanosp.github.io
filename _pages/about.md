ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I am a Research Fellow at the School of Computing and Engineering at the University of Huddersfield. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Grenoble Alpes University (France). My research focuses on Machine Learning, particularly in Continual Learning, and Automated Planning.

Over the years, I have worked on topics such as:

- AI Planning & AI modelling & Heuristic Search
- Machine Learning & Continual Learning
- Data Mining & Knowledge Representation
- Natural Language Processing

as well as a range of real-world applications including:

- Smart Grids
- Traffic Control
- Human Activity Recognition
- Autonomous decision-making systems.

I also enjoy teaching â€” I have over 645 hours of teaching experience at UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes, covering databases, data warehouses, text and graph mining, algorithms, and programming.

Beyond research, I am passionate about collaboration and supervision. I have co-supervised a PhD student and Master students on projects related to Continual Learning, Human Activity Recognition, and AI planning for engineering and Smart Grids.

ðŸ“„ You can explore my publications or connect with me to discuss opportunities for collaboration.
