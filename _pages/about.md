👋 Welcome! Engineer and PhD in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, currently working as a Researcher at the Laboratoire d’Informatique de Grenoble (LIG) and the Laboratoire de Génie Électrique de Grenoble (G2Elab) in France.

My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Automated Planning, with applications to smart power grids and autonomous decision-making systems.

Over the years, I have worked on topics such as:

- AI Planning & Heuristic Search
- Machine Learning & Continual Learning
- Data Mining & Knowledge Representation
- Natural Language Processing

I also enjoy teaching — I have over 645 hours of teaching experience at Université Grenoble Alpes, covering databases, data warehouses, text and graph mining, algorithms, and programming.

Beyond research, I am passionate about collaboration and supervision. I have co-supervised PhD and Master students on projects related to federated learning, human activity recognition, and AI planning for engineering and smart grids.

📄 You can explore my publications and projects, or connect with me to discuss opportunities for collaboration.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
